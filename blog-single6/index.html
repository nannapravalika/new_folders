              <p>Airline Pilot career is considered most sought-after career in India these days as the country requires nearly 17,000 pilots in next five to seven years. It requires great amount of training, dedication, and passion to become an Airline Pilot.

Pilots play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient air travel, and their training is governed by specific rules and regulations. In India, pilot training follows guidelines set by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
                <br>
                There are typically two routes into an aviation career as an airline pilot. The most preferred being the conventional pathway and the other one is Airline Cadet Pilot Training pathway.

                <br>
                This article helps you understand various features of these pathways and gives you a clear comparison so that you can opt for most convenient pathway based on your personal preferences.</p>
               
              <h4>Conventional Pilot Training Program:</h4>
